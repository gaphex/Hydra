# Instructions

We have created 2 folders in this zip archive. "full_list" contains the full list including PlanetLab proxies,
and "full_list_nopl" is the full list excluding PlanetLab proxies.

Each folder has a "_full-list.txt" file, which contains all of the proxies from all countries sorted by
speed; a "_reliable-list.txt" file contains the proxies which have 80% or higher reliability rate. We
have also created other text files for each seperate country, again these are sorted by fastest first.

You may use these proxies in any application with proxy settings, including web browsers, chat clients,
whois checkers, automated applications, etc

# What is PlanetLab?
#

PlanetLab is a global moderated proxy network. Since all servers are monitored and moderated, speeds will
be a lot faster than non PlanetLab proxies, however there are some disadvantages, such as captcha
authentication, sometimes the "post" form function is disabled and some pages are banned from viewing. For
those of you who are using these proxies for various applications, their limitations will most likely affect
you, and so we have decided to offer the two lists "full_list" and "full_list_nopl".
